# autotyper-gui
I made a really bad GUI for my autotyper... Some things don't work too well (GUI status output is currently not working)<br />
The ground work for the status output is already completed (the program is multithreaded so it can spam and update the gui at the same time)<br />
I'm just too lazy and busy currently to fix that
